Diamond Price Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. The project utilizes data preprocessing techniques and a Random Forest regression model to perform the task. It also answers several exploratory data analysis (EDA) questions related to the dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts diamond prices using features such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. The Random Forest regression algorithm is used in combination with data preprocessing techniques such as one-hot encoding for categorical variables and standardization for numerical variables.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 53,940 records with the following columns:

carat: Weight of the diamond
cut: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
color: Diamond color (D to J, where D is the best)
clarity: Clarity of the diamond (I1 to IF)
depth: Total depth percentage
table: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point
price: Price of the diamond
x: Length in mm
y: Width in mm
z: Depth in mm
The dataset does not contain any missing values and is a balanced dataset suitable for regression tasks.

Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diamond-price-prediction.git
cd diamond-price-prediction
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and open the notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the diamond_price_prediction.ipynb notebook and execute the cells.
Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features:

Categorical features: cut, color, clarity
Numerical features: carat, depth, table, x, y, z
Data preprocessing steps:

One-Hot Encoding is applied to the categorical features to convert them into numeric format.
Standardization is applied to the numerical features to bring them to a common scale (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).
Model Training
A Random Forest Regressor model is used to predict the price of the diamonds. The model is trained using the following steps:

Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into a 70-30 ratio for training and testing.
Pipeline: A pipeline is created to streamline the data preprocessing and model training steps.
Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The model is trained using only the following features: carat, cut, color, clarity, and the target variable is price.

MAE: The MAE for the model is calculated after training, providing insights into the average error between predicted and actual prices.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project also answers specific questions regarding the dataset, such as:

Numerical and categorical column counts
Cardinality of categorical columns (cut, color, clarity)
Statistical summaries such as mean, median, and standard deviation for specific columns
Dimensionality of the dataset: The dataset has 10 dimensions (features).
Usage
You can modify the notebook or reuse the code for different datasets by following the same structure. To train your own model:

Replace the dataset with your data.
Ensure the preprocessing steps are appropriate for the new dataset.
Re-run the notebook.
